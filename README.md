# Graphs-Final-Project
This repository is for the final Project Kelby and I are working on for our graph class. The data source that Kelby and I chose is this data source. We will be using two different data sets from this website. We will use routes.data and airports.data because we want to use airports as nodes and routes as edges. A sample row in airports.data would look like this 507,"Heathrow","London","United Kingdom","LHR","EGLL",51.4775,-0.461389,83,0,"E","Europe/London". The information included is airport ID number, name of airport, city of airport, IATA code of airport, and the latitude and longitude of the airport. For the routes.data a sample row would look like this BA,507,1234,"LHR","JFK". The 507 number represents the source airport ID, the 1234 represents the destination airport ID, LHR is the IATA code of airport, JFK is also the IATA code. The vertices of our graph would be the different airports and the edges would be the routes between them. We could ask many different questions such as what is the shortest path between airport A and airport B? Can you travel from airport C to airport D? Are all airpots reachable from one another? Which airport has the most incoming flight? Which airport has the most outgoing flight?
